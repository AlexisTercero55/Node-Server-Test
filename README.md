## Back-End App

This is a simple Node.js server app that serves a single PDF file when accessed.

## Installation

To install the app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/AlexisTercero55/Node-Server-Test.git
  ```
2. Run ``npm install`` to install the dependencies.

## Usage

To start the server, run `node .\file-server.js`. This will start the server on port 3000 by default.

To access the PDF file, make a ``GET`` request to the ``/pdf`` endpoint:

* Test the server by runing ``request.js`` script as ``node .\request.js``
* Test the server on the browser by ``http://localhost:3000/pdf``

The PDF file will be sent as an octet stream.
